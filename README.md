## 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    * DB_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    * HOST - set to host (i.e., localhost)
    * USER - set to username on your postgres server
    * PASSWORD - set to password for user on your postgres server
    * DB - set to database name for your postgres server
    * TEST_DB - set to test database name for your postgres testing server

    <!-- *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard -->
